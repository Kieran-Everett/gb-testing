# gb-testing
A repo for testing GameBoy code.

## Building
To build the code you need to have [GBDK](https://github.com/Zal0/gbdk-2020) in `C:\gbdk` or just change the make.bat files. If you are on Linux then you'll need to manually setup compiling the files. The `*.gb` files should be compiled to the newest version of the source code so it shouldn't need recompiling.

## Flappy Bird Clone
This is the main program that I have made and has been my first real introduction to coding C myself. There are quite a lot of problems with this as it was my first time using C and it's pretty complicated compared to Python. The game also has a few bugs like occasionally just vibe checking you with the first pipe not having a gap as well as the collision not working properly sometimes.
